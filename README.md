# gta5fov
GTA 5 mod for freely setting fields of view.

This is the developer README. For usage information see README.txt in the GTA5FoV folder.

Most of this code is auto-generated by https://github.com/mavenlin/Dll_Wrapper_Gen - the mod is executed in DllMain (dsound.cpp) and GTA5FoV.cpp, GTA5FoV.h and patches.h are the remaining handwritten code files.

I don't expect this code to contain much information of interest, but here it is anyway.

Bug reports and pull requests welcome!
